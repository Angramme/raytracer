# Context

This is a really simple ray-tracer that I made back in high school. The scene is hard-coded into the program (like in any good piece of software). Thus to change the scene you have to recompile. Moreover I didn't know how to use CMake at the time apparently, so you will have to work in VS2017 or write a build configuration yourself.
